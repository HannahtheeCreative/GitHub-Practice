1. Why is source control, especially Git, important for software development? Explain the problems that source control systems like Git help solve and the benefits they offer.

Source Control is important and incredibly useful when it comes to navigating between folders and files as well as acting as a place saver for projects that may otherwise be lost or go unsaved.

2. How do local and remote repositories differ, and why is synchronization between them essential when working with Git? Provide a clear understanding of these two aspects of Git.

Local and remote repositories differ based on access or file origin, local is typically used on one monitor/machine, while remote repositories can be shared discrectionally. For example, a developer working on a local repository has projects existing on his device; whereas a remote repository exists within an external hard drive or shared folder.
